 [Frontendmentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/password-generator-app-Mr8CLycqjh)

This is a simple password generator application built as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface for generating random passwords based on selected criteria.

## Overview

The Password Generator allows users to customize their passwords by selecting:

- Length of the password using a slider
- Types of characters to include (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) using checkboxes

The strength of the generated password is visually represented using color-coded bars.

## Features

- **Slider**: Adjust the length of the password from 1 to 20 characters.
- **Checkboxes**: Select which character sets to include in the password.
- **Password Generation**: Automatically generates a random password based on selected criteria.
- **Password Strength Meter**: Visual indication of the password strength based on selected criteria.
